Requirements for a Rails-based Battleship API, given to me as part of a job
application.

> Imagine you were building a 2-player, client-server battleship game, with each
> player playing from their own browser.  A javascript client would contact your
> API to start, play, and complete a game of battleship.  How that API works is
> up to you.
>
> Some requirements are:
>
>  * You must build it in rails
>
>  * The state of the game should be persisted in an SQL-based database
>    (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc)
>
>  * 2 players, 5 ships each
>
>  * The logic for determining when a player has won the game should be in your
>    backend, and not assumed to be handled by the frontend.
>
>  * The code quality doesn't need to be perfect, but please send us something
>    reasonably well-organized and formatted.
>
> Besides the limitations above, though, feel free to use any
> tools/gems/libraries you want.  You can use any internet resource you want,
> but don't have someone else do it for you, and don't use an existing
> implementation.
>
> The final deliverables we'd like are:
>
>  * The finished rails app
>
>  * A brief description of the series of API calls a hypothetical front-end
>    would use to play a game from ship placement through victory/defeat.
>
>  * A short writeup of how the development went, how long it took you, any
>   challenges you ran into, etc.
>
> This is intentionally left open-ended, so you get to make a number of
> decisions here.
